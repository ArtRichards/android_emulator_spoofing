THIS IS THE SPOOFING BRANCH!

This is a fork of the android emulator that allows you to spoof IMEI, IMSI, and phone number.  You should be using this with r10 of the Android SDK.

Use the command line options -imei, -imsi, and -phone-number

Don't forget to set the ANDROID_SDK_ROOT environment variable to wherever the rest of the SDK is.

files provided with the public Android Software Development Kit (SDK).

To download them, go to http://code.google.com/android/

Emulator-specific documentation is available at the following page:

Please read the INSTALL file to see how you can rebuild the emulator, or
